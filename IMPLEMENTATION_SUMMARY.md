# MeterMate Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Mission: Simple Manual Entry for Energy Dashboard

We're building a focused integration that solves one problem well: getting data from utility bills and dumb meters into Home Assistant's Energy Dashboard.

## 📋 What We Built (Current Status)

### 1. Core Data Management (`data_manager.py`)
- **Simple Storage**: Uses Home Assistant's JSON storage system
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, read, update, delete utility readings
- **Statistics Integration**: Pushes data to Home Assistant's statistics system
- **Validation**: Prevents bad data from corrupting the system

### 2. Sensor Entity (`sensor.py`)
- **Energy Dashboard Compatible**: Proper device_class and state_class
- **Shows Current Total**: Displays cumulative consumption
- **Restores State**: Maintains values across Home Assistant restarts
- **Updates Automatically**: Reflects new readings when added

### 3. Service Interface (`services.py`)
- **5 Core Services**:
  - `add_reading` - Add new utility data
  - `get_readings` - Query existing data
  - `update_reading` - Fix mistakes
  - `delete_reading` - Remove bad data
  - `recalculate_statistics` - Refresh statistics

### 4. Configuration Flow (`config_flow.py`)
- **UI Setup**: Create meters through Home Assistant's UI
- **Simple Config**: Name, unit, device class, initial reading
- **No Complex Options**: Just the essentials

## 🔧 Current Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Service Call → Data Manager → JSON Storage
                                      ↓
          Energy Dashboard ← Statistics System ← Sensor Update
```

### Key Files
- `data_manager.py` - Core logic for data storage and statistics
- `sensor.py` - Entity that shows up in Energy Dashboard
- `services.py` - API for managing readings
- `config_flow.py` - UI for setting up new meters

## ✅ What's Working
- Integration loads successfully
- Sensor entities are created
- Service calls work (add/get/update/delete readings)
- Data persists across restarts
- Sensor value updates when readings are added

## 🔄 Current Issues
- **Statistics Integration**: Still getting "Invalid statistic_id" errors
- **Energy Dashboard**: Data not appearing in energy graphs yet
- **Historical Data**: Need to verify historical readings work correctly

## 🎯 Immediate Goals
1. **Fix Statistics**: Resolve statistic_id format issues
2. **Verify Energy Dashboard**: Ensure data appears in energy section
3. **Test Historical Data**: Confirm past readings work correctly
4. **Validate Workflow**: Test complete user workflow end-to-end

## 📝 User Experience (When Working)
1. User sets up "Manual Meter" through Home Assistant UI
2. User receives utility bill: "350 kWh used in January"
3. User runs script or service call: `metermate.add_reading`
4. Sensor updates to show new total
5. Energy Dashboard shows January's consumption

## 🚀 Success Definition
When a user can:
- Set up a meter in 2 minutes via UI
- Add readings via simple service calls
- See their data in Energy Dashboard immediately
- Edit/delete readings if they make mistakes

**Current Status**: 80% complete - core functionality works, just need to fix statistics integration
