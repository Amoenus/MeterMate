**A comprehensive data source for manual utility readings with full CRUD capabilities**

MeterMate is a Home Assistant custom integration that transforms manual utility data entry into a powerful, user-friendly experience. It provides full Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) capabilities for managing utility meter readings and seamlessly integrates with Home Assistant's Energy Dashboard.

## ðŸŽ¯ Value Proposition

MeterMate adds significant value by:

- **Full CRUD Interface**: Complete data management for all your utility readings
- **Dedicated Data Source**: Acts as a standalone data source specifically for manual utility data
- **Energy Dashboard Integration**: Seamlessly exposes data as if it were from smart meters
- **User-Friendly Management**: Intuitive service interface for all data operations
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains consistency and provides validation for all entries

## âœ¨ Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Complete Data Management**: Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Multiple Data Entry Methods**: Cumulative meter readings and periodic consumption data
- **Bulk Operations**: Import multiple readings at once from spreadsheets or bills
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation with helpful error messages
- **Audit Trail**: Track all changes with operation IDs and timestamps

### Integration Features
- **Energy Dashboard Ready**: Works directly with Home Assistant's Energy Dashboard
- **Service Interface**: Rich set of services for automation and scripting
- **Multiple Utilities**: Electricity, gas, water, and custom utility types
- **Flexible Units**: Support for kWh, mÂ³, gallons, and custom units

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed
2. Go to HACS > Integrations
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner and select "Custom repositories"
4. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/Amoenus/metermate`
5. Select "Integration" as the category
6. Click "Add"
7. Find "MeterMate" in the list and click "Install"
8. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Amoenus/metermate/releases)
2. Extract the files to your `custom_components` directory
3. The final directory structure should be: `custom_components/metermate/`
4. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Search for "MeterMate"
4. Follow the configuration steps:
   - **Name**: Give your meter a friendly name (e.g., "Main Electricity Meter")
   - **Unit of Measurement**: Select the appropriate unit (kWh, mÂ³, gal, etc.)
   - **Device Class**: Choose the device class (energy, gas, water, volume)
   - **Initial Reading** (optional): Enter your meter's current reading to start tracking from zero

## Usage

Once configured, MeterMate creates a sensor entity that you can use with the Energy Dashboard. To add readings, use the `metermate.add_reading` service:

### Service: `metermate.add_reading`

#### Parameters:
- `entity_id`: The MeterMate sensor entity
- `value`: The numeric value to add
- `mode`: Either "cumulative" (default) or "periodic"
- `timestamp` (optional): When the reading was taken (defaults to now)
- `start_date`/`end_date` (optional): Date range for periodic readings

### Examples

#### Adding a Cumulative Reading
```yaml
service: metermate.add_reading
data:
  entity_id: sensor.main_electricity_meter
  value: 15650  # Current meter reading
  mode: cumulative
```

#### Adding Periodic Consumption
```yaml
service: metermate.add_reading
data:
  entity_id: sensor.gas_meter
  value: 45.2  # Consumption for the period
  mode: periodic
  start_date: "2023-05-01"
  end_date: "2023-05-31"
```

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

MeterMate provides a comprehensive set of services for managing your utility data:

### Add a Meter Reading
